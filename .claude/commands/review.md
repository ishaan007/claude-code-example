2. **Security**: Identify security vulnerabilities (XSS, injection, exposed secrets, etc.)
3. **Code Quality**: Check for code smells, duplication, and maintainability issues
4. **Best Practices**: Ensure the code follows language/framework conventions
5. **Error Handling**: Verify proper error handling and edge case coverage

Provide specific, actionable feedback with file paths and line numbers. Prioritize issues by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
